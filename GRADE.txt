Nice work!

- Great job with the validations.

- `Reservation belongs_to :flight`, I'm guessing should probably be `:restaurant`

- Unless a column is going to potentially have a lot of characters (e.g., a user's personal bio), you
should use the `string` column, instead of `text`.

- Make sure to use the new Ruby Hash syntax: e.g., `presence: true` instead of `:presence => true`
