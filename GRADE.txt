Nice work!

- Great job with the validations.

- `Reservation belongs_to :flight`, I'm guessing should probably be `:restaurant`

- Unless a column is going to potentially have a lot of characters (e.g., a user's personal bio), you
should use the `string` column, instead of `text`.

- Make sure to use the new Ruby Hash syntax: e.g., `presence: true` instead of `:presence => true`

Milestone #2 Grade

Score: (10/10)

- It seems like your app is querying only for reservations for a specific user (e.g., `@reservations = User.find_by(username: "mengwang").reservations.where(canceled: false)`).
Make sure these queries work for all users.

- To follow Rails conventions, methods named `delete` should instead be named `destroy`

- Missing `has_secure_password` on `User` model.
